The idea was to study these topics within as natural a setting as possible and to analyze how infant feeding decisions by the household interact with various social, economic, and environmental factors to affect health, nutritional, demographic, and economic outcomes. The cohort of children born during that period, their mothers, other caretakers, and selected siblings have been followed through subsequent surveys conducted in 1991-92, 1994, 1999, 2002, and 2005.
